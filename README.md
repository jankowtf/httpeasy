The goal of httpeasy is to …

## Installation

You can install the released version of httpeasy from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("httpeasy")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(httpeasy)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
